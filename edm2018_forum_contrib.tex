% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org
%
% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

\title{QuanTyler : Apportioning Credit for Student Forum Participation}

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.
% \additionalauthors{Additional authors: John Smith (The Th{\o}rv{\"a}ld Group,

\begin{abstract}
%  We develop a random forest classifier that helps assign academic
%  credit for a student's class forum participation. Our twelve predictors
%  are quantities that are easily available from typical forum facilities, such
%  as number of endorsed contributions, number of questions asked, number of answers, and number of posts viewed. We add page rank and centrality to these base measures. The classification target are the four classes created by
%  student rank quartiles. Course content experts provided ground truth
%  by ranking a limited number of post pairs. We expand this labeled set
%  via data augmentation. We compute the relative importance of the
%  predictors, and compare performance in matching the human expert
%  rankings, as we vary the number of predictors used in training. We
%  reach multiclass AUC measures between 0.64 and 0.94, depending on the
%  number of deployed predictors. This performance is compared with the
%  simple formulae that are currently used by some instructors for
%  estimating the amount of credit to apportion for forum activity in
%  their classes. To test generality and scalability,  we trained the
%  classifier on the archive of the Economics Stack Exchange
%  reputation data. We used this classifier to predict the quartile
%  assignments by human judges of forum posts from a University Artificial Intelligence course. Our first attempt at transfer learning reaches an average
%  AUC of 0.69.
